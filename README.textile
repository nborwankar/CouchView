h2. Overview



This JQuery plugin lets you map a CouchDb view to a html grid. That’s it. I looked at the other JQuery grid plug-ins – many of which a really great –  But I couldn't get them working and since I’m lazy I wrote this specialized plug-in. 

So here are its features:



    * It's HTML agnostic. Y ou can use tables or divs or any HTML to layout your data.

    *  You can view JSON data from any source – such as CouchDB.

    * You get column sorting.

    * You get paging paging

    * It's compatible with JEditable. So you can edit your data.

    * Really small – Currently under 3K.

    * Coded in a clean fashion so you can subclass header/body or footer generation and the loading and saving of data.
